------------------

- Internal API change. Due to new CM spec requirements, we had to update
  internals. That should not touch ordinary users, but can affect some external
  plugins. If you are plugin developper - see migration guide:
  https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/5.0_migration.md.
- Updated CM spec compatibility to 0.22:
  - Keep tabs (don't replace with spaces).
  - Don't wrap iframes with paragraphs.
  - Rewritten emphasis algorithm.
- Fix closure compiler collisions (don't use reserved words), #159.


4.4.0 / 2015-07-18
------------------

- Updated HTML blocks logic to CM 0.21 spec.
- Minor fixes.
